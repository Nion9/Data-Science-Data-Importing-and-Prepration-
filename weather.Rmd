## Initial Section:

## Submission for Part A: Data Understanding


```{asis, echo=TRUE}

----------------------------------

1- The data set description goes here

This dataset includes five months' worth of weather data from three cities in 2024: Canberra, Melbourne, and Sydney. The dataset contains characteristics like temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, etc., and each row represents a single day. This dataset is useful for researching climate behaviour, examining weather trends, and making predictions for various weather scenarios in certain cities.




----------------------------------
```
```{r}
#----------------------------------#

# 2-  The code for task 2 goes here
# Generate summary statistics for the dataset
summary(weather)



#----------------------------------#

# 3-  The code for task 3 goes here
# Generate a histogram of temperature readings
hist(weather$Temperature, main = "Temperature Distribution", xlab = "Temperature (°C)", col = "lightblue")



#----------------------------------#
```
```{asis, echo=TRUE}
4- The reflection and notes for task 2 and 3 goes here

For task 2, Based on the summary statistics, we can see that the temperature varies from 2°C to 37°C, and the humidity levels vary from 50% to 100%. The pressure stays between 995 and 1015 millibars, which is a somewhat small range.



For task 3, The temperature measurements' histogram, which displays a fairly uniform distribution over the range with some concentration in the 20–30°C range, represents the usual weather for the cities that were chosen.

## Overall Conclusion

I gained knowledge of a variety of data manipulation strategies from this assignment, such as looping, matrix operations, data wrangling, and condition handling. My practical abilities in handling real-world data sets were enhanced by working with weather data, and the insights gained from data analysis could be useful in climate studies and weather forecasting.
